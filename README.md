### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Link O'Brennan (he/him)

I am a queer and trans educator, aspring anthropologist, and alumni of the WGST and ANTH programs at CU Boulder. I'm not currently working on any specific projects, but I love investigating sociological and anthropological data to inform a more thorough and honest understanding of our history and our present. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating or have something to share!
